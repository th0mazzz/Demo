//for file stuff:
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Demo2{
  public static void main(String[]args){
    String fileName = "file.txt";
    try{
      File f = new File(fileName);//can combine
      Scanner in = new Scanner(f);//into one line
      
        //NOW read the file here...
      
    }catch(FileNotFoundException e){
      System.out.println("File not found: " + fileName);
      //e.printStackTrace();
      System.exit(1);
    }

    //How can we use the file here? Where should you put it?
  }
}




Reading the file line by line:

while(in.hasNext()){
        String line = in.nextLine();
        //do something with line
        System.out.println(line);
}

Reading the file word by word:

while(in.hasNext()){
        String word = in.next();
        //do something with word
        System.out.println(word);
}

The java Scanner is super useful! It is an easy way to parse through files.
