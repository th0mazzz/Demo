- Mostly in class discussion. We did some branch testing and decided to just work in one branch called minimal-working.

01/04/2018
- The Minimal_Gui class was created. It contains a basic window with no functionality as of yet. It was created on branch "minimal_gui" and merged into master.
- The very basic Assignment class has been created, and is on the branch "assignment"

01/05/2018
- Very basic Subcategory and Subject classes were written

01/06/2018
- Vastly improved on Subcategory and Subject classes: many methods were written

- Tried to make a navigational system through the terminal via the main function of User.java. I had to change the toString() of Subject.java (written by Meredith) to try and implement this functionality. However, I was only able to get ONE goal to work (that was "back") and everything else did not. I am doing this to because once you can navigate through the arrays via the terminal, I feel like that would vastly improve understanding navigating through GUI.
