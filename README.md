# Saturn Grades
SaturnGrades repository of our project

- Was able to get reading and writing functionality (absurdly long time to do)
- Reading function takes data from storage.txt (presumably from a previous write) and initializes the array with that data exactly how it was written
- Writing function writes the data in the array into storage.txt so then it can be read the next time the program is run
- Since Meredith and I are working in seperate spheres (her on GUI, and I on command line), our basic code has diverged quite a bit from each other's(entirely my fault, shoudl've communicated more as the backend dude); need to address this when we can

01/12/2018
- got the GUI working (ha! to people who said I couldn't)
- moved on from the minimal working version GUI and began writing second version, more updates soon to come

01/11/2018
- Created calcAverage() for SaturnGrades.java
- Wrote a toString() for SaturnGrades.java
- Made a relatively large driver for SaturnGrades.java and tested it for two new functions that were created and made functional today: displayBasic() and displayInformed()
- Self note: mostly done with the classes themselves, need to implement reading/writing first, then command line functionality, then (if Meredith gets it, otherwise not) GUI
- May need to add a few functions to support the reading/writing of files
- Minor tweaks here and there (forgot what minor tweaks though... heh...)
-(hi it's Meredith) I got a GUI to open but I still need it to switch between pages for minimal-working version

01/10/2018
- Created a new folder and revamped am currently revamping each individual class for command line functionality
- Revamping means changing old functions, making new ones, to make coding the command line code easier
- Meredith's trying to get GUI to work

01/09/2018
- Tried making some very basic GUI code late at night; there are some obstacles that need figuring out
- Created separate drivers for each .java file (mostly)

01/09/2018
(done together)
- wrote new toStrings for all classes- toString should display all information pertaining to an object
- also wrote some new accessor methods
- tested the subcategory function
- fixed a merge conflict/rebase error

01/08/2018
- Tried to make a navigational system through the terminal via the main function of User.java. I had to change the toString() of Subject.java (written by Meredith) to try and implement this functionality. However, I was only able to get ONE goal to work (that was "back") and everything else did not. I am doing this to because once you can navigate through the arrays via the terminal, I feel like that would vastly improve understanding navigating through GUI.

01/06/2018
- Vastly improved on Subcategory and Subject classes: many methods were written

01/05/2018
- Mostly in class discussion. We did some branch testing and decided to just work in one branch called minimal-working.
- Very basic Subcategory and Subject classes were written

01/04/2018
- The Minimal_Gui class was created. It contains a basic window with no functionality as of yet. It was created on branch "minimal_gui" and merged into master.
- The very basic Assignment class has been created, and is on the branch "assignment"
