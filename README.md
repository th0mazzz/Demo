- Created a new folder and revamped am currently revamping each individual class for command line functionality
- Revamping means changing old functions, making new ones, to make coding the command line code easier
- Meredith's trying to get GUI to work

01/09/2018
- Tried making some very basic GUI code late at night; there are some obstacles that need figuring out
- Created separate drivers for each .java file (mostly)

01/09/2018
(done together)
- wrote new toStrings for all classes- toString should display all information pertaining to an object
- also wrote some new accessor methods
- tested the subcategory function
- fixed a merge conflict/rebase error

- Tried to make a navigational system through the terminal via the main function of User.java. I had to change the toString() of Subject.java (written by Meredith) to try and implement this functionality. However, I was only able to get ONE goal to work (that was "back") and everything else did not. I am doing this to because once you can navigate through the arrays via the terminal, I feel like that would vastly improve understanding navigating through GUI.

01/06/2018
- Vastly improved on Subcategory and Subject classes: many methods were written

01/05/2018
- Mostly in class discussion. We did some branch testing and decided to just work in one branch called minimal-working.
- Very basic Subcategory and Subject classes were written

01/04/2018
- The Minimal_Gui class was created. It contains a basic window with no functionality as of yet. It was created on branch "minimal_gui" and merged into master.
- The very basic Assignment class has been created, and is on the branch "assignment"
