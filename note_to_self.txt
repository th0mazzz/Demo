Need to have a check for names and dates (make sure they're one worded) idea: you can replace all spaces with - s

You need to check that input dates and grades are valid as to not make NumberFormatException (done with Subcategory weight input, need for Assignment grade)

Nice touchup: have the program display subjects / subcategories / assignments as you're putting in input
