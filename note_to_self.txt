Need to have a check for names (make sure they're one worded)
and neither can date for assignments be either

You need to check that input dates and grades are valid as to not make NumberFormatException


Also change your calcAverages exceptions to exits to make more elegant looking

Nice feature: have the program display subjects / subcategories / assignments as you're putting in input
